  <h1>Who am I?</h1>
  
  <p><br>Hi there!</br> My name is Victoria, and I'm a tech student for the performing arts. This means I get to spend my time plugging cables into outlets, programming lighting designs, and blasting music through a sound system.</br></p> 


    
  <p>I also do hair and makeup designing for the shows performed on campus. I've made a college student pass for a senior citizen, and drawn fake tattoos that were so convincing, even people <em>with tattoos</em> thought they were real.<br>One of the reasons they looked real is because I used a green sharpie, as opposed to a black one, since a green hued ink is common in slightly older tattoos. The link below explains this.
